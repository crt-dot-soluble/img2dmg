# FAQ

## Does this upload my images?
No. All processing happens locally in your browser.

## Why must ZIPs contain a single extension type?
This keeps batch processing predictable and avoids mixed encoding outputs.

## Why do grayscale exports end with -gs?
The suffix makes it easy to distinguish grayscale output from DMG output.
